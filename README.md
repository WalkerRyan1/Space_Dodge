# Space_Dodge
<br>
My first attempt at game development in Python.
This game is not live on any platform and is in development.

## Technologies
 - Python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - PIP (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
 - Pygame (https://pypi.org/project/pygame-ce/)
 - PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)


## Getting Started
First, be sure to have python, pip, and pygame installed (see links above to install).

Next, you will want to download the zip file from this repository.

Unzip the file and run it in the PyCharm IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Once the file is open in PyCharm you will see a play button at the top right area of the IDE. 
Click that to start the game.

Have fun!
